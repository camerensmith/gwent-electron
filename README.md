## 🏛️ Factions

### Novigrad - New Faction

Novigrad is a free city that hosts all manner of denizens not particular in allegiance to one faction or another. Previously cards from the Witcher Universe and new Novigrad-specific characters are added here. In some ways, Novigrad is a "catch all" faction.

**Playstyle:** Novigrad doesn't introduce many new mechanics and is fairly basic in their playstyle in classic Gwent faction, except for the addition of **Witch Hunt**, which targets the lowest power cards in the opposite row. This provides a powerful counterbalance to zerg-like deck compositions.

**Key Features:**
- Witch Hunt ability - destroys weakest units in opposite row
- Balanced, straightforward playstyle
- Diverse characters from the Witcher Universe

---

### Northern Realms - Major Updates

Northern Realms received extensive changes to make them more balanced and emphasize a more conservative playstyle. As they are known for their military might (particularly Redania and Temeria), their proclivities rely on building and maintaining a strong board presence.

**New Abilities:**
- **Fortify** - Bolsters a single unit occupying that row, providing a massive counter to scorch or kill-heavy decks while giving an enormous boost to a unit alone
- **Veterancy** - Units get stronger as the battle draws out, rewarding you for keeping units on the board longer

**Playstyle:**
- Strong individual units and powerful heroes
- Close combat and siege combat oriented
- Some deficiency to ranged combat
- Conservative, board-presence focused strategy

---

### Nilfgaard - Reworks

Nilfgaard's units were weakened a bit, relying more on tight bond and middle-of-the-pack strength gains. Some larger monsters round out the strength curve, but generally, they're firmly mid in strength average.

**Unique Abilities:**
- **Bribe** - Manipulates opponent decks and discard piles
- **Conspiracy** - Further deck manipulation to turn the tides in your favor
- Best (cheapest) spies in the game

**Playstyle:**
- Intricate spy and espionage network
- Best spy units in the game
- War of attrition through card advantage
- Mid-strength units with strategic abilities

---

### Monsters - Major Updates

Added many new monster cards and reworked mechanics. They're heavily reliant on bond, which makes sense since monsters generally come at you in hordes.

**New Abilities:**
- **Sacrifice** - Targets the weakest unit on your side and automatically pulls a higher strength unit from your deck in its stead. Useful for bluffing or sending out unexpected stronger units
- **Necromancy** - Only the "Necromancer" unit has this extremely strong ability. Allows weak units to be resurrected en masse, providing quick strength advantage (like a from-the-grave muster)
- **Curse** - Acts like Spy in that you place a unit on the opposite side, adding to enemy strength total. However, when the next unit enters that row, both the Curse and target units are killed. A double-edged sword for both players

**Playstyle:**
- Stronger-than-average heroes
- Relatively mid and weak-tier monsters (for balance)
- Horde-based strategies with bond
- Dark arts and resurrection themes

---

### Scoia'tael - Changes

Scoia'tael had too many muster units, so this was culled down. Also, their units were too strong, so strength values were brought down.

**Playstyle:**
- Reliance on agility (close and ranged) for vast majority of units
- Dwarves round out the field as defense-first frontline fighters
- Strong frontline guard with flexibility in row placement
- Very susceptible to weather effects (lack of Siege presence)

**Unique Ability:**
- **Waylay** - Works like Spy. Ambush Units stay on the enemy's side and contribute to their strength total. When another unit enters that row, the Waylay-bearing card is discarded and the Scoia'tael player receives two cards. Strategic denial of rows while gaining card advantage.

---

### Skellige - Changes

Skellige has among the strongest base-strength units, making sense because they're essentially berserking beefed-up warriors/Vikings.

**Abilities:**
- **Avenger** - Left intact from original
- **Berserker** - Left intact from original
- **Tactics** - Allows any "ship" card to be brought onto the Tactics card's row, allowing for quick maneuverability of units on the field
- **Skellige Storm (Tempest)** - Unique weather card that affects BOTH ranged and siege, reducing those rows to 1 strength for each unit

**Playstyle:**
- Strong Close and Siege presence
- Raid and Pillage theme with strong, agile naval fleet
- Can play Tempest tactically against decks emphasizing ranged and siege
- Close range berserkers can buff up while enemy ranged/siege is weakened

---

### Witchers - Complete Rework

Added many lore-ful witchers that were not present. This is perhaps the most unique faction.

**Unique Features:**
- Unlike other factions, they don't have access to neutrals like Decoy, Scorch, Cull
- Rely on the strongest units in the game (witchers) belonging to one of five schools
- Synergistic play if more than 1 Witcher from that school is in play
- Wide array of unique spells in the form of **Witcher Signs** - 5 in total - that can shift the tide of battle

**Playstyle:**
- Fewer units than other factions (by nature)
- Grounded by powerful Hero units in the form of Castles (training grounds per school)
- Castle units remain on battlefield provided they've shared synergy with a witcher from that school
- High risk, high reward
- Weak to weather and kill abilities, extremely strong otherwise

---

### Toussaint - Major Reworks

Toussaint relies on the dichotomy of their base units transforming into hero vampires.

**Unique Weather:**
- **Nightfall** - When this weather hits, base units transform into hero vampires, or get pulled from your discard pile

**Playstyle:**
- Most heroes aren't played traditionally - they need to be coerced by the night
- Strong abilities in **Wine** (advanced Morale)
- Strong bond and muster units
- Different playstyles not necessarily reliant on vampire transformation
- Can play effectively even without Nightfall

---

### Lyria & Rivia - Changes

Lyria and Rivia was expanded and reworked to be stronger defensively, with a larger siege presence and as a counterplay to siege-heavy strategies.

**Lore:** L&R are prideful, valiant, and strong smaller empires.

**Unique Features:**
- Unique row shielding abilities
- Units that scorch siege - unique to L&R
- Strong siege presence
- Counterbalance to siege-heavy strategies (since siege is generally the strongest and least-utilized row)

---

### Syndicate - Major Reworks

Syndicate is the crime network that operates out of the depths of Novigrad's underbelly and beyond. Illegal brawling, murder, racketeering, et al.

**Unique Abilities:**
- **Embargo** - Stops opponent's deck drawing
- **Execute** - Uniquely kills solo hero units (generally, heroes cannot be killed)
- **Shakedown** - Removes strength bonuses from a unit
- **Shackles** - Placed on a row and precedes a unit's ability, disallowing ability triggers upon enter

**Playstyle:**
- About control, even if their units are not particularly strong strength-wise
- Make up for weakness with controlling the flow of the game
- Shady dealings and manipulation

---

### Zerrikania - Changes

Leaning into the exotic theme, they have a menagerie of snakes, hyenas, leopards, and other fauna amidst worshippers that buff powerful units.

**Changes:**
- Worshippers are now hero units, emphasizing board permanence
- Buffed (and added) their sacred dragons
- Access to more weather effects than normal neutrals would allow

**Playstyle:**
- Cheap units with board control
- Large, buffed units
- Heroes are among the weakest in the game
- Weather-focused strategies

---

### Ofir - New Faction

Ofir is a completely new faction that benefits from your opponent's aggression.

**Unique Ability:**
- **Trade** - Triggers at certain strength intervals, allowing you to draw a card from your deck for free
- **Adaptive** - Units can brave harsh elements, reducing their strength to 2 instead of 1 in weather, allowing you to edge out basic units in close and ranged combat

**Unique Weather:**
- **Sandstorm** - Affects Close and Ranged combat

**Playstyle:**
- Emphasizes drawing and swarming
- Units are generally weak by themselves
- Make up for weakness with attrition and amassing an army
- Benefits from opponent aggression through Trade ability
