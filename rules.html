					<h2 class = "content-subhead">What is Gwent?</h2>
					<p>
						<b>Gwent</b>
						<i>(a.k.a Gwynt)</i>
						used to be a minigame in the video game
						<b>The Witcher 3</b>
						developed by CD Project.
						<br />
						It was designed to be a collection card game in which you could play your cards against the computer.
						<br />
						You would start with a basic starting deck which you could improve in parallel of the game story and quests by buying more cards here and there or by defeating characters in the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was never designed to be a balanced game. NPCs don't complain, so the idea was to build a deck with all the strongest cards possible to try to always win.
						<br />
						Adapting Gwent to be multiplayer is consequently not an easy task. Furthermore, the game could grow boring because there are obvious optimal decks and optimal ways to play the game.
						<br />
						Players would usually do the same things over and over.
						<br />
						Fortunately, it does not stop the game from being very interesting and full of potential, which is why we wanted to push it even further, especially with a vast universe like The Witcher.
					</p>
					<h2 class = "content-subhead">But how does it play?</h2>
					<p>
						Gwent is played with 2 players. They start with the same number of cards and take turns to play these cards one by one until both players pass or are out of cards.
						<br />
						At the end of each round the strength of each player's cards is summed to calculate their score. The player with the highest score wins the round.
						<br />
						<b>First player to win two rounds wins the game.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Gwent is sometimes compared to poker because bluff plays an important role.
						<br />
						Usually you want to win a round with as few cards as possible but since each player can lose a round, you might want to convince your opponent you are trying to win the round and push him/her to play more of his/her best cards, while saving yours.
						<br />
						Cards are a limited resource in the game, so winning requires to make a better use of them.
					</p>
					<h2 class = "content-subhead">Board layout</h2>
					<div class = "pure-g">
						<div class = "pure-u-1-8">
							<img class = "pure-img-responsive" src = "images/rules/board_layout.jpg" alt = "Gwent board layout" />
						</div>
						<div class = "pure-u-7-8">
							<p>
								In Gwent, the board is a battlefied divided in two parts, the side of each player.
								<br />
								Each side is made of three distinct rows:
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Melee</b> (or Close Combat)
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Ranged</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Siege</b>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Most cards can be played in only one of these rows. Some special cards can affect only one row at a time.
								<br />
								Concentrating cards in a row or on the contrary spreading them across your side of the battlefield will be important strategic decisions.
							</p>
							<p>
								This division of the board in three rows and the effects which can apply to them are an important factor in the specificity and elegance of Gwent.
								<br />
								For many players, this is a crucial part missing in the more recent standalone official Gwent game.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h2 class = "content-subhead" id = "cards">So, what are these cards?</h2>
					<p>
						In Gwent, there are 3 major kinds of cards:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Leader cards</b>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Unit cards</b>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Special cards</b>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Leader cards</h3>
					<div class = "pure-g">
						<div class = "pure-u-1-8">
							<img class = "pure-img-responsive" src = "images/lg/monsters_eredin_commander.jpg" alt = "Example of leader card" />
						</div>
						<div class = "pure-u-7-8">
							<p>
								Each player has one and only one leader card, which is chosen before the start of the game. It is not part of the deck.
								<br />
								This card is not played on the battlefield, it remains face up on the side until the end.
								<br />
								It does not have a strength value but it has a strong ability which can affect the board and cards.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Unit cards</h3>
					<div class = "pure-g">
						<div class = "pure-u-1-8">
							<img class = "pure-img-responsive" src = "images/lg/neutral_olgierd.jpg" alt = "Example of unit card" />
							<img class = "pure-img-responsive" src = "images/lg/neutral_ciri.jpg" alt = "Example of hero card" />
						</div>
						<div class = "pure-u-7-8">
							<p>
								This is the main category of cards, these are the ones with a strength value and which allow to increase the player's score in the round.
								<br />
								Some units have an ability (some even have two), allowing them to affect the board or combine with other cards in order to further increase (or decrease) the scores of players.
								<br />
								These abilities allow to increase the strength of some of your units, summon more cards or remove some other cards from the boad.
								<br />
								Unit abilities is most likely the most important part of the game because it is what brings variety and unpredictability, forcing players to read the opponent strategy and style and react to it approprietly.
								<br />
							</p>
							<p>
								A small portion of these units are
								<b>Hero</b>
								units, their visual is slightly different than the others. Hero units are not affected by any ability, yours or the opponents.
								<br />
								This means that these cards cannot be removed before the end of the round and their strength cannot be changed. Exceptions to this rule are very very rare.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unit cards can usually be played in only one of the three rows, which is indicated on the card. Some can be placed in one of two rows.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Special cards</h3>
					<div class = "pure-g">
						<div class = "pure-u-1-8">
							<img class = "pure-img-responsive" src = "images/lg/special_horn.jpg" alt = "Example of special card" />
							<img class = "pure-img-responsive" src = "images/lg/weather_fog.jpg" alt = "Example of weather card" />
						</div>
						<div class = "pure-u-7-8">
							<p>
								Special cards have no strength but have a powerfull ability which can have a significant effect on the board. They usually either affect a specific or the entire board.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some special cards have a direct effect and are discarded right after use.
								<br />
								Some provide a durable effect on a row until the end of the round or before another ability removes it. These cards are not played on the battlefield but in a dedicated slot on its side.
							</p>
							<p>
								A category of these special cards is worth a specific mention, they are called
								<b>Weather Cards</b>.
								<br />
								These cards apply a malus in a specific row but for both players at the same time (all unit cards strength is lowered to 1).
								<br />
								They are a powerfull tool which can change the course of a game. Fortunately, there is one special cards allowing to cancel these weather effects, when you have one in your, that is.
							</p>
							<p>
								These cards play an important role in the strategy of Gwent and in its elegance. They are simple but deadly, it is crucial to anticipate the possibility of the opponent playing them.

										<b>2:</b>
										Card's row. This icon indicate to which row(s) the card can be placed. Sword means Melee row, Bow means Ranged row and Catapult means Siege row. In some cases, the icon while contain 2 elements, indicating that the card can be placed in several rows, at choice.

					</div>
					<h2 class = "content-subhead" id = "abilities">Abilities</h2>
					<p>
						This card game revolves a lot around a set of abilities, they allow to develop strategies and adapt/react to the opponent's.
						<br />
						The beauty of Gwent is that the number of abilities remains rather low and easy to grasp.
						<br />
						Unlike the official modern Gwent game where each card has a unique effect, the original Gwent has multiple cards having the same ability.
						<br />
						Consequently, it is much easier to understand what a card does (a quick look at the card is usually enough) and what a deck can do.
					</p>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Abilities available (Alphabetical)</h3>

								<p>
									Adaptive units are more resilient to weather effects than standard units. While most units are reduced to 1 strength by weather, Adaptive units maintain a base strength of 2, making them valuable in weather-heavy matchups. This ability is particularly useful for Ofir faction units that need to overcome harsh environmental conditions.

									<br />
									Note that if the card that should be summoned is in your hand or deck, it will be taken from there. Otherwise, it will be "created" but it will not go into your graveyard when removed.

								<p>
									Berserker units are initially not very strong, and thus not very interesting if not combined with Mardroeme.

The blockade animation stays static on the opponent's deck throughout their next turn, preventing them from drawing cards by any means. The effect is removed when the opponent's turn ends.

								<p>
									In a way, the Tight Bond ability behaves similarly to the Muster ability. These cards are part of a "familly" and are stronger together.
									<br />
									For each card of the same familly (same or similar name) with the Tight Bond ability, the base strength of the card is multiplied by the number of copies in the same row.
									<br />
									So if you have managed to play 3 copies, each card will have its value tripled. All combined, the total will be 9 times higher than without the ability.
									<br />
									The power of this ability is that you can reach a very high strength on the row, so high that it will be very difficult for your opponent to match it (with 3 cards you have the strength of 9 cards).
									<br />
									However, this very strength is also its main weakness. Since these cards are copies, they share the same strength and tend to be the strongest cards on the board, easy target for Scorch.

									When the corresponding special card is played, all of your cards on the board being marked (having the ability) are destroyed and move to the discard pile.

									This ability is a slight variation of Scorch. Instead of affecting the entire board for both players, it affects only one of the opponent row.
									<br />
									If the total strength present in that row is 10 or higher (heroes included), it destroys the strongest units of the row (but not heroes).

								<p>
									Originally, the target row of this effect was the opposite row the card is played in.
									<br />
									However, we have changed it to always target the Melee row to make this ability a little more usable/effective and predictable, because most factions have a lot more Melee units than the other rows.

								<p>
									The power of this ability resides in the fact it can quickly add several cards to the board and increase your total score.
									<br />
									Its weakness is that the cards often have the same strength and can consequently be destroyed all at the same time if not played carefully.
									<br />
									Also, keep in mind that if you have several Muster cards of the same familly in hand, playing one of them will play all the copies in hand, putting you at a disadvantage.

								<p>
									In a way, the Tight Bond ability behaves similarly to the Muster ability. These cards are part of a "familly" and are stronger together.
									<br />
									For each card of the same familly (same or similar name) with the Tight Bond ability, the base strength of the card is multiplied by the number of copies in the same row.
									<br />
									So if you have managed to play 3 copies, each card will have its value tripled. All combined, the total will be 9 times higher than without the ability.
								</p>
								<p>
									The power of this ability is that you can reach a very high strength on the row, so high that it will be very difficult for your opponent to match it (with 3 cards you have the strength of 9 cards).
									<br />
									However, this very strength is also its main weakness. Since these cards are copies, they share the same strength and tend to be the strongest cards on the board, easy target for Scorch.
									<br />
									Also, a single copy of such a card isn't very strong, the most important part is managing to gather several copies.

						The Witcher universe is vast, so to bring more variety and fun to the game, it is divided into several factions.

						Factions usually represent a realm or a group/faction of people. Each faction has its own set of cards along with a faction ability, and thus its own playstyle.
						<br />
						A faction ability, often passive (triggered at a specific moment of the game) but sometimes active as well (used at the discretion of the player), will have a significant influence on the way to play the game because you need to adapt to it to make the best of it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before to start the game, a player must chose the faction to play, which will define the set of leaders and units that can be used to build the deck.

									Skellige focuses on Siege power, with Berserkers and Avenger abilities, along with special mechanics like Tactics and Storms. Their Berserker units transform into powerful bears when Mardroeme is played, creating devastating combos. Avenger units transform into stronger units when removed from the board, providing long-term value. Skellige Tactics consolidates naval units onto a single row for maximum synergy. They also have access to Skellige Storm weather cards that affect multiple rows, and a balance of Tight Bond, Muster, and Medic units.

									Witcher Universe relies on strong heroes and unique signs. This faction features witchers from various schools (Wolf, Viper, Cat, Bear, and Griffin), each with school-specific synergies that boost each other when multiple witchers of the same school are on the board. Witcher Keeps have the Resilience ability, staying on the board between rounds when paired with their corresponding witcher school. The faction has a variety of cards representing the broader Witcher universe, with powerful heroes and unique sign-based abilities that provide strategic depth.

									Toussaint relies on Nightfall and Wine abilities. Toussaint Wine boosts all units in a row by 2, providing stronger row bonuses than standard Morale Boost. Nightfall is a unique weather card that affects all rows and triggers Hunger transformations on units with the Hunger ability, allowing vampires and other creatures to transform into their true forms. This faction has a balance of Tight Bond, Muster, and Scorch units, along with many strong cards representing the opulent and dangerous duchy of Toussaint.

									Lyria & Rivia are strong against opponent Siege units, with unique Scorch - Siege abilities that specifically target enemy siege units. They have access to Shield abilities that protect entire rows from opponent abilities (except weather), making them excellent at defensive play. This faction also has Decoy units and Shield special cards, along with Muster and Medic cards. Their defensive capabilities and siege-focused removal make them effective at controlling the battlefield and protecting their own units while disrupting enemy siege strategies.

									Syndicate relies on Execute, Bank, and Witch Hunters. Execute allows units to destroy hero cards when they're alone in the opposite row, providing a powerful counter to hero-heavy strategies. The Bank special card provides simple card draw, giving card advantage. Witch Hunt units destroy the weakest units in the opposite row, making them excellent counters to Muster strategies. This faction also has access to Spies, Muster, and Tight Bond units, creating a versatile mix of removal, card advantage, and board presence.

								<p>
									Zerrikania features the Worshipper/Worshipped mechanic and Inspire abilities. The dragon cult uses Worshipper units that boost Worshipped units by 1 for each Worshipper on the board, creating powerful scaling synergies. Free Warriors have the Inspire ability, where all Inspire units take the highest base strength among them, allowing weaker units to match the strongest. This creates interesting strategic decisions about when to play stronger Inspire units to boost the entire group. The faction ability ensures that Worshippers can be recovered after losing rounds, maintaining the synergy throughout the game.

								</p>
								<p>
									Ofir features the Trade mechanic and Adaptive units. Trade units automatically draw cards when the opponent's total power reaches specific thresholds (12, 24, 36), rewarding patience and allowing the player to build card advantage over time. Adaptive units have a base strength of 2 (instead of 1) while affected by Weather, making them resilient to weather effects. Ofir can cause Sandstorms, a unique weather effect that reduces Close Combat and Ranged Combat units to 1. This faction excels at overcoming the elements and building incremental advantages through trade and adaptive strategies.

					<h2 class = "content-subhead" id = "setup">Setup</h2>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Building your deck</h3>
					<p>
						To play, each player must chose a faction, a leader and select or prepare a deck of the selected faction.
						<br />
						We have prepared a selection of decks which we think are interesting to play and reasonably balanced.
						<br />
						However, you can constitute your own, the only rules are the following:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Minumum 22 unit cards</b>
								(heroes included) from the selected faction or neutral cards.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Maximum 10 special cards</b>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tips:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The more cards you have in your deck, the less likely you are to draw the best cards and make the combos work. Chose wisely, here less is more.
							</li>
							<li>
								Hero cards might look powerfull at first, but in the end they are boring and are not the cards that win games because most of them have a limited impact.
								Consequently, don't take too many of those.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Start</h3>
					<p>
						A coin toss decides who starts first. Each player shuffles his/her deck and draws 10 cards. Before starting the game, each player can discard up to 2 cards and draw a replacement (aka Mulligan).
						<br />
						The remaining 10 cards will constitute the starting hand of the players, and most likely all the cards the players will have for the game.
					</p>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead">Rounds</h3>
					<p>
						Players take turns either playing a card or using the active ability of their leader or faction (when available).
						<br />
						A player can instead chose to pass and sit out of the rest of the round (not play any hard), while the other player is free to play more cards.
						<br />
						When both players have passed or cannot play any other card, the round ends. The player with the lowest total strength loses a round and a life point.
						<br />
						Each player starts with 2 life points and thus loses the game when losing 2 rounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that in case of a draw, both players have the lowest strength and lose a life point. Unless you play as Nilfgaard (wins in case of draws), this is not a desirable situation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The players that wins the round plays first in the next round.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Counting the total score can be really bothersome, good thing that here the computer is doing it for us.
						<br />
						But it remains important to understand how it's done in order to anticipate the changes when playing certain cards.
						<br />
						Here are the principles to count the scores.
					</p>
					<p>
						For each row:
						<ul>
							<li>Weather effects always apply first, before anything else. They change the base strength of the unit cards.</li>
							<li>Some rare faction/leader abilities also affect the base strength. Weather takes precedence over them, but if no weather effect is active, apply these changes first.</li>
							<li>From this point, consider that the strength is calculated from the most specific ability of the card to the more global effects.</li>
							<li>First we apply the Tight Bond effects.</li>
							<li>Then we apply the various boosts (Morale, Witcher School, Toussaint Wine etc), which simply add up one another, order does not matter.</li>
							<li>Last, always last, we apply the row multipler, being the Commander's Horn.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3 class = "content-subhead" style = "text-align:center">
						That's it, now you know everything you need
						<br />
						to play a round of Gwent!
